Immunogenicity - Tiered Approach to Assess ADA Positive Samples

#### <i class="fa fa-table" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tiered approach for immunogenicity sample analysis
- The screening assay is used to determine whether samples are positive or negative for the presence of ADA
- Confirmatory analysis utilizing the percent signal inhibition is then used to find true positive
- Further characterization such as ADA titer is reported with positive samples and further drug-neutralizing potential is investigated
