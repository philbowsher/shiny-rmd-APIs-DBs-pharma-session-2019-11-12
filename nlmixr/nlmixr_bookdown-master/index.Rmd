# Welcome to population modeling in R {-}
The fact that you are here suggest that you have an interest to do population modeling in R! Maybe you found this through our [nlmixr website](http://nlmixr.org/wp/). Maybe via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nlmixr), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/start/join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fgroups%2F8621368&trk=login_reg_redirect), or [GitHub](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr). Either way: **welcome, and join us in our journey towards population PKPD modeling with R!**

This book is intended to get you started with [nlmixr](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr), an R package for nonlinear mixed effects models in population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) . You'll get information on the package itself, its installation, interesting use cases and more.
